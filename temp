#pip install google-cloud-pubsub

Option A: Using Cloud Dataflow:
      Create a Dataflow job that reads from Pub/Sub and writes into BigQuery.
      Use the Pub/Sub to BigQuery template available in Dataflow:
      Go to Dataflow in Google Cloud Console.
      Create a new job from the template.
      Choose Pub/Sub to BigQuery.
      Input your Pub/Sub topic (banking-transactions-topic) and BigQuery table (banking_dataset.transactions).
      Run the job to start streaming data into BigQuery.
